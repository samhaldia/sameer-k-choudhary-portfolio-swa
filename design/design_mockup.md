The chosen palette uses a professional base with an accent color to highlight key information and provide visual interest.

* **Primary Background**: `#F8FAFC` (Light Gray - Tailwind `bg-slate-50` or `bg-gray-50`) - Provides a clean canvas.
* **Secondary Background/Card Background**: `#FFFFFF` (White) - For content cards and sections that need to pop.
* **Primary Text**: `#1E293B` (Dark Blue-Gray - Tailwind `text-slate-800`) - Excellent readability for body text and headings.
* **Accent Color**: `#06B6D4` (Cyan/Teal - Tailwind `text-cyan-500` or `bg-cyan-500`) - Used for highlights, active states, icons, and call-to-action elements.

## 5. Animation Effects

All animations will be subtle, purposeful, and designed to enhance the user experience without being overwhelming. Tailwind CSS will be primarily used for these effects, potentially with transition and animate classes.

    * Social icons: fade-in-up with a slight delay for each.
* **Navigation Links**: Smooth scroll behavior on click.
* **Cards (Experience, Projects)**: `hover:shadow-lg` and `hover:translate-y-[-5px]` (slight lift).
* **Buttons & Links**: `hover:bg-opacity-80` or `hover:text-cyan-600` for color changes.
* **Skills**: Individual skill "pills" could have a slight bounce effect on initial load or a fade-in when their section is revealed.
